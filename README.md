### Hey ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?
Hey! My name is Jack and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at [CodeHS](https://codehs.com), based in Chicago. I earned my BS in Computer Science from the Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SUNY Binghamton University.

Iâ€™m always learning and hacking â€” from building web and mobile apps, to developing games, designing robots, or picking up new programming languages (Iâ€™ve got over 10 under my belt!). Learning is my passion, and my projects reflect a wide range of interests and skills.
