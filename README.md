### Hey ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?
Hey! I am a Software Developer from Chicago currently studying for a BS in Computer Science in the Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SUNY Binghamton University. I'm always busy learning and hacking, ranging from designing web apps, to mobile apps, to developing a game, to building a robot, or learning new languages. I currently have knowledge in over 10 languages! Learning is my passion! You can expect a wide range of projects on my page!
