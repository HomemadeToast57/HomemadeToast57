### Hey 👋

### Who am I?
Hey! My name is Jack and I’m a Software Engineer at [CodeHS](https://codehs.com), based in Chicago. I earned my BS in Computer Science from the Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SUNY Binghamton University.

I’m always learning and hacking — from building web and mobile apps, to developing games, designing robots, or picking up new skills. Learning is my passion, and my projects reflect a wide range of interests and skills.
