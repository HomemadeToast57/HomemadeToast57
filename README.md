### Hey 👋

### Who am I?
Hey! I am a Software Developer from Chicago currently studying for a BS in Computer Science in the Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SUNY Binghamton University. I'm always busy learning and hacking, ranging from designing an app, to developing a game, to building a robot, to learning a new language. I currently have knowledge in over 10 languages! Learning is my passion! You can expect a wide range of projects on my page!
