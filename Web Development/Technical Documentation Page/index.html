                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of
                        the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p>

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { <br> alert("Hello " + yourName); <br> }
                        <br>
                    greetMe("World");
                    <br>
            </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42</code>. This syntax
                        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        By simply giving a variable a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword let. For example, <code>let y = 13</code> or <code>y = (10*2)</code>. This
                        syntax
                        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                        below.
                    </p>

    <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <article>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                            is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                            other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                            Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                            unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>and Object</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
            to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
            are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
            objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
            your application can perform.
